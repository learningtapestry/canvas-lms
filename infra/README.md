# Canvas LMS — GCP/GKE Infrastructure Summary

Building blocks and context for the Canvas LMS cloud infrastructure. This is the
high-level map; see `infra/gke/README.md` and the per-directory READMEs for
operational detail.

## Project context

- **Goal:** migrate Canvas LMS off its current Cloud66/AWS (EC2 + Redis +
  Postgres) hosting onto **Google Cloud / GKE**, starting lean with a single
  `staging` environment and managed data services. Prod follows later as a copy
  with larger tiers + HA.
- **File storage:** the running app uses **local file storage** (confirmed with
  the dev) — no object storage. On k8s this is a ReadWriteOnce Persistent Disk
  shared by the single-replica web+jobs pods. (The earlier "S3-compatible
  service" idea is set aside; object storage would be a future option.)
- **Reference:** patterns (module + manifest layout, External Secrets,
  cert-manager, Workload Identity) were modelled on an existing EKS setup, then
  simplified for GKE. No content from that reference lives here.

## The application (what we're deploying)

- **Canvas LMS** — large Rails 8 / Ruby 3.4 monolith. **We track the
  `cloud66-prod` branch** — the exact code Cloud66 runs in production (has
  `config/*.yml.cloud66` templates + `.cloud66/` deploy metadata).
- **Web:** served by **Passenger on :3000** (non-root, Autopilot-friendly). NOT
  `rails server`/Puma — Canvas sets `public_file_server.enabled=false`, so it needs
  Passenger/nginx to serve `public/dist` (else assets 404). Started with
  `--start-timeout 300` (the 90s default is too short for the preloader).
- **Workers:** **inst-jobs** (`delayed_job`) + `switchman-inst-jobs`, run via
  `script/delayed_job run`. **Not Sidekiq.**
- **HTTPS is mandatory:** Canvas hardcodes `config.force_ssl=true`, so the session
  cookie is `secure` — over plain HTTP login fails with CSRF 400. TLS terminates at
  the ingress. `SECRET_KEY_BASE` is also required (Cloud66 auto-injects it; on GKE
  Terraform supplies it).
- **Data deps:** PostgreSQL, Redis (cache + job locking), **local file storage**
  for attachments (no buckets — confirmed with the dev). **No Elasticsearch.**
- **Config (matches Cloud66):** env-var driven. The image ships
  `config/*.yml.cloud66` templates; each pod's start command copies
  `*.yml.cloud66 → *.yml` (the Cloud66 `after_checkout` hook), then boots.
  `amazon_s3`/`outgoing_mail` are not copied → local storage, no SMTP.
- **Real env var names** (from cloud66-prod): `POSTGRESQL_ADDRESS/PORT/DATABASE/
  USERNAME/PASSWORD`, `REDIS_ADDRESS/PORT`, `CANVAS_REDIS_DB`, `ENCRYPTION_KEY`,
  `JWT_ENCRYPTION_KEY`, `CANVAS_DOMAIN`, `CANVAS_LMS_ADMIN_EMAIL`,
  `FILE_STORAGE_PATH_PREFIX`.
- **Stack (cloud66 manifest):** Ruby 3.4.9, Node 20, Postgres 18.3, Redis 8.6.2.
- **Image:** built from `cloud66-prod` using the repo's maintained
  **`Dockerfile.production`** (runs `bundle install` + `canvas:compile_assets`).
  The repo `Dockerfile` is dev-only.

## GCP project

| | |
|---|---|
| **Project ID** | `propane-country-501515-c2` (display name "NBD Math for the DTRI" — shared project, empty of prior infra) |
| **Region** | `us-central1` |
| **Billing** | Enabled — `billingAccounts/0197F0-B92603-CB825F` |
| **Org** | No organization; policy `iam.allowedPolicyMemberDomains` is set (restricts cross-domain IAM grants) |
| **Default network** | An auto-mode `default` network exists; we provision a separate custom VPC |
| **APIs enabled** | compute, container, sqladmin, redis, servicenetworking, artifactregistry, secretmanager, dns |

## Architecture building blocks

| Layer | GCP building block | Notes |
|-------|--------------------|-------|
| Network | Custom VPC + subnet (VPC-native ranges), Cloud NAT, Private Service Access | Private nodes/data; egress via NAT |
| Compute | **GKE Autopilot** | Managed nodes/scaling; WI on by default; **control-plane public endpoint restricted to authorized networks** |
| Web | `canvas-web` Deployment (Passenger :3000), single replica, `Recreate` | Service maps 80→3000; colocated with jobs (RWO PD) |
| Workers | `canvas-jobs` Deployment (`script/delayed_job run`), single replica | inst-jobs; colocated with web on the RWO PD |
| Migrate | `canvas-db-migrate` Job | `db:initial_setup` first run, then `db:migrate` |
| Database | **Cloud SQL** for PostgreSQL **18**, private IP, zone-pinned `us-central1-f`, **SSL `ENCRYPTED_ONLY`** | `db-custom-2-7680` staging (matches prod 18.4 for clean dump/restore) |
| Cache/jobs | **Memorystore** for Redis, **AUTH disabled** | matches cloud66 `redis.yml` (plain redis://) |
| Attachments | **Local storage** on a **ReadWriteOnce PD** (`canvas-files` PVC) | web+jobs single-replica, colocated (approach B); prod → Filestore/object storage |
| Registry | **Artifact Registry** (Docker) | Canvas image (built from cloud66-prod) |
| Secrets | **Secret Manager** + External Secrets Operator | `POSTGRESQL_*`, `REDIS_ADDRESS`, `ENCRYPTION_KEY`, `JWT_ENCRYPTION_KEY`, `SECRET_KEY_BASE` |
| Identity | **Workload Identity** + 3 GSAs (app, external-secrets, cert-manager) | fully keyless (no static SA keys) |
| Ingress/TLS | **ingress-nginx** + cert-manager (Cloud DNS DNS01) | LB = GCP regional external passthrough Network LB (L4) @ 35.222.47.79; 10g upload limit |

## Authentication model

- **Workload Identity** is the primary mechanism (GKE analogue of EKS IRSA):
  each Kubernetes ServiceAccount impersonates a least-privilege Google service
  account — no static keys. On Autopilot it's enabled by default.
  - `canvas-app` → Cloud SQL client, Secret Manager accessor (secret-scoped).
  - `canvas-external-secrets` → Secret Manager accessor.
  - `canvas-cert-manager` → Cloud DNS admin.
  - `github-actions` → Artifact Registry writer (via Workload Identity
    Federation, for the image-build workflow).
- **No static keys anywhere.** Local file storage removes the need for any object-
  storage credential. (A temp HMAC key + SA existed only for the one-off data
  migration and have been deleted.)

## Crypto keys (ENCRYPTION_KEY / JWT_ENCRYPTION_KEY / SECRET_KEY_BASE)

- Terraform generates random keys for a **fresh** install. When importing existing
  data (the prod migration), the data is encrypted with the source instance's keys,
  so Canvas must reuse them — supply out-of-band and **never commit**:
  `export TF_VAR_encryption_key=… TF_VAR_jwt_encryption_key=… TF_VAR_secret_key_base=…`
  then `apply`. `coalesce(var.x, random_password.x.result)` picks the override if set.
- After swapping keys against existing data, run `db:reset_encryption_key_hash`.

## Repository layout (all in this repo — nothing committed elsewhere)

```

Terraform modules are app-agnostic and version-pinned (`google ~> 6.0`,
Terraform `>= 1.5`). State: GCS backend, bucket
`propane-country-501515-c2-tf-state`.

## Key decisions

1. **Lean first** — one staging env, managed data services, defer prod/HA and
   Elasticsearch.
2. **GKE Autopilot** — removes node-pool/autoscaler/CSI ops (team has k8s
   experience but no need to run nodes).
3. **Managed data** — Cloud SQL + Memorystore instead of self-hosted pods.
4. **Local file storage** on a RWO PD (approach B) — matches current prod; cheap
   for staging. Prod needs Filestore (RWX) or object storage.
5. **Reuse the cloud66 config templates** — copy `*.yml.cloud66 → *.yml` at
   start; matches exactly how the running app is configured.
6. **Passenger on a high port** — required (Canvas disables `public_file_server`)
   and avoids privileged-port/root issues under Autopilot.

## Current status

- **DEPLOYED AND RUNNING**, serving **real migrated production data**. Terraform
  applied; Helm add-ons installed; image built from `cloud66-prod`; manifests applied.
- **Data migrated** from the prod EC2 (`18.234.235.110`) via a temp GCS bucket:
  14 GB / 2727 media files onto the `canvas-files` PVC (byte-for-byte match) + full
  PG dump (6 users / 20 courses / 9700 attachment rows). Temp bucket + HMAC key + SA
  since deleted.
- **Secret Manager reconciled** — the app secret (version 5) holds the prod crypto
  keys, Terraform-managed via `TF_VAR_*` (not committed).
- **Hardening applied** — GKE control-plane locked to the operator's authorized
  network; Cloud SQL enforces `ENCRYPTED_ONLY`.
- **Branch:** `infrastructure` (in this repo), pushed to `origin`.
- Temp access: `https://35.222.47.79.nip.io` (self-signed cert).
- **Admin login:** `https://35.222.47.79.nip.io/login` — email
  `gke-admin@learningtapestry.com` (site + default-account admin). Password shared
  privately (not committed). Recreate/reset via the idempotent rails-runner snippet
  (User + Pseudonym on `Account.default`, granted `Account.site_admin`).

## Open items / to fill

- **Replace the control-plane authorized network** — it currently allows a single
  operator IP (`/32`); swap for a stable VPN/office CIDR in `terraform.tfvars`.
- Real **hostname** + **trusted cert** (cert-manager webhook x509 CA issue, or a
  real domain + Let's Encrypt) to replace the self-signed nip.io cert.
- Prod file storage: move off the single RWO PD to Filestore (RWX) or object
  storage for HA/scale.
- **Outbound email** relay (placeholder in `outgoing_mail.yml`).
- Open the PR for the `infrastructure` branch.
